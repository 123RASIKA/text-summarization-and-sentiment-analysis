# text-summarization-and-sentiment-analysis
It combines both the techniques of text summarization and sentiment analysis for a text data.
In the text summarization module , the summary of the document is created using NLP extractive approach for summarization,
which functions by identifying the important sentences or excerpts from the document and reproduce
them as a part of the summary.
In Sentiment Analysis module, a summarized text is used to predict the opinion, emotion, or attitude of a whole
documen. In this project, sentiments are categorized as "positive" or "negative". Deep neural netork is being used for developing sentiment analyzer.
The system consists of two modules:
1. Text Summarization
2. Sentiment Analysis
Algorithms used in summarizing the text are:
->Bag of Words (BOW) model
->Heapq (Heap Queue)
-> Tf-IDF ( Term Frequency- Inverse Term Frequency) model
Deep Learning approaches used for Sentiment Analysis used are:
-> Simple/Basic Neural Network
-> RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)-LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
